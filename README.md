# A LaTeX template for the thesis of computer engineering undergrads at the National University of Singapore (NUS)
The `nuscegthesis.cls` document class formats your document according to the NUS [textual](http://ceg.nus.edu.sg/CG4001/forms/FYP_appendix_1_Oct09_Guide.pdf), [visual](http://ceg.nus.edu.sg/CG4001/forms/FYP_appendix_2_Mar10_ThesisFormat.pdf), and [cover/title page](http://www.ceg.nus.edu.sg/CG4001/forms/documents/CoverNTitlePage_CG4001_000.pdf) guidelines from the National University of Singapore.

`example-thesis.pdf` is created from the source files in this repository.

I've only tested that it works on overleaf.com. If you find bugs or missing features, submit a pull request against the master branch. Happy thesis writing!
